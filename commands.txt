Commands to remember:
1) command to build the code
    gcc encrypt.c -o encrypt

2) command to run the code
    ./encrypt 2 keyfile.txt

3) command to send a (any) file to the code and print the reslt into a result file (in the same directory)
    cat test2.txt | ./encrypt 1 /home/leeor/Desktop/Apple/test.txt > result

4) command to run with a dpendent file (queue). The result file will called queue
    gcc -o program encrypt.c queue.c

5) command to use gdb to debug (and find seg-faults)
    gcc -g encrypt.c -o program
    gdb ./program
    (once in the program) run 32 test.txt < test2.txt

6) command to use valgrind to check memory leaks.
    gcc -g encrypt.c -o program
    valgrind ./program 8 test.txt < test2.txt
    (Or with more info run) valgrind --leak-check=full ./program 8 test.txt < test2.txt
